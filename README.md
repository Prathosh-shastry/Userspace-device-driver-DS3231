# Userspace-device-driver-DS3231
My role and aim in this project were to interface an Embedded system to the Real-World sensors such as DS3231 Real-time clock via the I2C bus. With the help of C++ object-oriented programming, functionality such as reading, writing into registers to set time, date, alarm, interrupt enabled event and square wave functionality, and other novel features such as low power consumption mode and battery-backed square wave enable. Lastly, the pre-written standard Linux RTC Loadable Kernel Modules are used to integrate RTC to check its functionality.
